--------------------------------------------------termRegex--------------------------------------------------
Explanation
    sign            consists of one or none symbol, if none we assume it's '+', thus the '?' qualifier.
    coefficient     is any number of zero or more length, if length is zero we assume it's the 1 coefficient,
                    thus the '*' qualifier.
    variable_name   consists of letter 'x' and a number identifier that MUST exist, thus the '+' qualifier.
Note that
    we don't care about whitespaces, we remove it all, thus we can assume these are the expected positions.
    But, we allow multiple occurances of a variable name with no sign, in case the user tries to parse
    a non-linear problem or simply omits the '+' at the beginning.
    For example, x1x2 + x3 = 0. We check it later on, on demand.
